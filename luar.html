 <h3>why divorces becoming bigger?</h3>
 <p>The increase in divorce rates and divorces becoming more common can be attributed to several social, economic, and cultural factors:

Changing Social Norms: Societal attitudes toward divorce have evolved over time, making divorce more socially acceptable and less stigmatized compared to previous generations. This shift in attitudes encourages individuals in unhappy marriages to seek divorce as a viable option.

Increased Financial Independence: Women's increased participation in the workforce and greater financial independence have reduced economic barriers to divorce. Financial stability outside of marriage allows individuals to consider divorce without fear of financial hardship.

Higher Expectations of Marriage: Modern expectations of marriage often include emotional fulfillment, personal growth, and compatibility. When couples feel they are not achieving these expectations, they may choose divorce as a means to pursue happiness and fulfillment elsewhere.

Changes in Legal System: Legal reforms in many countries have simplified divorce processes, making it easier and quicker for couples to dissolve marriages. This has contributed to higher divorce rates as it reduces the logistical and legal barriers to ending a marriage.

Communication and Conflict Resolution Issues: Couples may struggle with communication, conflict resolution, or other relationship skills essential for maintaining a marriage. Without effective tools to navigate challenges, some couples may find divorce as the only solution to persistent marital issues.

Cultural and Religious Shifts: As societies become more diverse and multicultural, traditional cultural or religious prohibitions against divorce may carry less weight for some individuals and communities.

Impact of Media and Technology: Media portrayal of relationships, as well as online dating and social media, can influence relationship dynamics and contribute to both relationship success and dissolution.

It's important to note that while divorce rates have increased, not all marriages end in divorce. Many couples still successfully navigate challenges and remain committed to their marriages. Understanding the factors contributing to higher divorce rates helps in addressing the underlying issues and supporting healthy relationships.</p>

Germany is hosting EURO 2024, having been chosen to stage the 17th edition of the UEFA European Championship at a UEFA Executive Committee meeting in Nyon on 27 September 2018. Türkiye was the only other nation that bid to hold UEFA EURO 2024. West Germany hosted the 1988 edition, but this is the first time Germany has staged the UEFA European Championship since reunification. The 2006 FIFA World Cup also took place in the country.


What are the dates for EURO 2024?
The UEFA EURO 2024 final tournament began on 14 June and runs until 14 July 2024. The group stage concludes on 26 June, with the knockout stage beginning on 29 June.

As the host nation, Germany were seeded in Group A and occupied position A1; they therefore played the opening match – a 5-1 win against Scotland – at the Munich Football Arena on Friday 14 June. Germany/West Germany have featured at every EURO since 1972. West Germany won the 1972 and 1980 editions, while the reunited Germany triumphed at EURO '96.

Who qualified for EURO?

The draw for the final tournament was held in Hamburg on Saturday 2 December.

Group A: Germany, Scotland, Hungary, Switzerland
Group B: Spain, Croatia, Italy, Albania
Group C: Slovenia, Denmark, Serbia, England
Group D: Poland*, Netherlands, Austria, France
Group E: Belgium, Slovakia, Romania, Ukraine*
Group F: Türkiye, ﻿Georgia*, Portugal, Czechia
